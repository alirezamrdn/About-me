## 📝 About Me

I am a senior software engineer and architect with over 17 years of experience designing, developing, and modernizing complex backend systems.

My core strengths lie in Java (JavaEE, Spring Boot), microservices architecture, and cloud-native development using **AWS, Azure**, and **Google Cloud**.  
I’ve led and contributed to high-impact projects across industries like banking, e-commerce, logistics, and digital health — including systems processing over **17 million transactions daily**.

Throughout my career, I've successfully modernized legacy applications, migrated monoliths to microservices, and improved system scalability and maintainability using **clean and hexagonal architecture**.

I’m also experienced with tools and technologies such as **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD** (Jenkins, GitLab, Bamboo), and DevOps workflows.  
I enjoy mentoring team members and fostering collaborative environments.

If you're looking for someone who understands enterprise-level complexity but also moves fast and delivers clean, testable code — I’m ready to help.
